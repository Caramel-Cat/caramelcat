<h1>Caramel Cat Manifesto (or White-Paper if you want)</h1>

<pre>

This text will be better understood if read after the Bitcoin White Paper.

In that document, Satoshi says:

<i>A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly 
from one party to another without going through a financial institution.</i>

Despite the propaganda, Satoshi <b>did not remove the intermediary</b>, but just created a kind 
of lottery, called mining, to decide who would be the next intermediary to execute the transactions.

The lottery is a problem that, in theory, can only be solved by trial-and-error method. 
However, as the cost of electricity to solve the problem varies from machine to machine 
and from person to person, it is an unfair lottery. 

<b>Imagine a lottery where some buy each card for 1 cent while others need to pay 1 dollar per 
attempt, for instance. Bitcoin is like that.</b>

This situation leads to a super-concentration of miners who have access to specialized lottery 
hardware and cheap electricity. The truth is, while it's been a tremendous economic success, 
Bitcoin is an idea that has failed. <b>The purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash still doesn't 
exist and is probably impossible to exist.</b>

Bitcoin is centered not only on the big miners, but also on the few super-specialized developers. 
Get 20 people together in a room, all the Bitcoin controllers are there.

All other cryptocurrencies suffer from the same Bitcoin problems and only achieve
"improvements" over Bitcoin making decentralization even worse.

Although it is a failure in technical terms, Bitcoin made clear the possibility of non-state money. 
The blockchain, as a transparency mechanism, is very promising.

The great function of money is to facilitate the exchange of real goods and services that improve our lives.
While electronic money without intermediaries is impossible, there are some advances here.

Perfect money should be easily understandable by everyone, manageable by everyone, split and rejoined 
without loss, auditable, watched at all times, and <b>with an escape route if it's taken over by anyone, at 
the exact point where it's no longer considered honest</b>.

Bitcoin tried to be a decentralized electronic money, but it turned into an infinite greed that burns 
tons of electrical energy that could be being used in the production of something useful.

"The price of democracy is eternal surveillance"

The same is true for electronic money.

CaramelCat aims to be a step forward in the direction of "perfect money". Reliable, fast and honest.
